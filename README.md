# TDD With React

I wanted to learn how to use TDD with React. I'm following the [Jest Tutorial](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react)

## Heading I'm working on now:


## To Run App

1. Clone the repo.
2. From the command line, cd into the project directory (in this case, it's ```/TDD-React/tdd-react```)
3. ```npm install```
4. ```yarn install```
5. ```npm start```

## To Test App

1. Ensure you're in the ```/TDD-React/tdd-react``` directory
1. From the command line run ```yarn test```
1. This will continue to watch the tests and notify you if one fails.
